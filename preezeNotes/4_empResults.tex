Specifically, I find that a pair of countries ij that have an ideal point distance of one point less than another pair – a one point change is equivalent to the interquartile range of the UNGA ideal point distance variable – are, on average, approximately 35\% more likely to sign a BIT across models 2 and 3.

if an ij pair both have already formed a BIT with a country k. This model predicts that the probability of i forming a BIT with j is 43\% more likely than i forming a BIT with a country to whom it does not share an indirect tie. 

The “Popularity” network effect is also notable but much less important. For example, a country that has signed 10 more BITs than another is 13\% more likely to form additional BITs, or receive requests for BIT formation, with states to whom it is not connected.

To determine whether or not the network based approach I employ here actually approx- imates the data generating process behind the BITs network, I conduct rolling out-of- sample predictions across the time frame of this analysis for each model. To do this, I run a SAOM model on a four year moving window of the data, then predict agreements in the subsequent year using the derived parameter estimates, and then validate the predicted ties against the actual data. 

For model 1 the AUC is equal to 0.75, for model 2 0.83, and for model 3 0.94
Dyadic model AUC = 0.56.
