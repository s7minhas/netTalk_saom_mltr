What did we learn about BITs?
==
In many ways, BITs provided the ideal institution through which to constrain state behavior. When a country violated one of these agreements, the affected parties could easily make the violation public by requesting arbitration at the ICSID, and then have some reasonable expectation for compensation.

The reason why I find BITs so particularly interesting is because in many ways they are the ideal international institution through which to constrain state behavior. When a country violates one of these agreements, the affected particies could easily make the violation public by requesting arbitration at ICSID. Thus their is clear reputational damage. And, second, they could also receive compensation for damages, thus there is a tangible material cost for violation. 

Given this framing scholars sought to explain the formation of this system of treaties under the credible commitment and competition for capital argument. But both arguments somewhat hinged on the idea that countries understood the implications of these agreements and thus they gave a careful consideration to the potential costs. 

Yet, when we test those arguments using a network based approach we find no evidence for those extant arguments. And instead we find evidence that some of the drivers for the evolution of this network are endogenous network effects and an effort by countries to highlight their interstate relationships.
